# TrafficSignIdentifier
Neural network that detects german traffic signs.

Using TensorFlow, a popular library for creating neural networks, I trained and tested my model with the German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark (GTSRB) dataset
which is publicly available. The model has an accuracy of 95%.
